\subsection*{Nanopulser head}

\subsection*{Control box}

One symptom of a blown fuse can be that  the pulser does communicate but either does not produce light, or produces a smaller, wide pulse.


\subsection*{Cable design}


The ethernet cables should {\bf never} be unplugged from the box, while the power is on, as the power for both the digital electronics, as well as for the pulser circuits runs through them. Accidental hot-swapping can result in one of the fuses blowing. 

\subsubsection*{Connection box}

At the final installation, the cables should be wrapped with a tie-wrap inside the junction box, to avoid damage to the connection by accidentally pull the cables.
