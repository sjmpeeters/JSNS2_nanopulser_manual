The \jsns experiment ~\cite{JSNS2TDR} is a relatively small liquid scintillator detector. It relies on precise timing in order to seperate the scintillation light from Cherenkov light, which is crucial for background and signal separation. This note describes the \jsns2 nanopulser optical calibration system that will be used to do the timing calibration, as well as the gain calibration.

We start with a description of the requirements as set by the \jsns collaboration. Next is a description of the system in the experiment. We then describe the control software, followed by a section on the analysis strategy.
