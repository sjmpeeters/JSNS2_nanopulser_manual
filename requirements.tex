The calibration system has the following requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The system is controllable via simple to use, and flexible software.\\ 
\emph{This is what we provided.} \missing[inline]{SJMP: fill \& add reference}
\item The part of the system that is inside the LAB filled volume is compatible with LAB.\\ 
\emph{This is what we provided.} \missing[inline]{SJMP: fill \& add reference}
\item The system does not cause interference on the PMT array.\\ 
\emph{This is what we provided.} \missing[inline]{SJMP: fill \& add reference}
\item Each pulser produces a very small width in time optical pulse (less than 1 ns risetime at low intensities and less than 2 ns falltime).\\ 
\emph{This is what we provided.} \missing[inline]{SJMP: fill \& add reference}
\item The system provides full optical coverage of the PMT array for both 420~nm and 355~nm.\\ 
\emph{This is what we provided.} \missing[inline]{SJMP: fill \& add reference}
\item The system provides a trigger pulse that can be delayed, with negative amplitude and less than 1 1~V, to be read-out with one channel of the VX1721 flash ADC read-out system.\\
