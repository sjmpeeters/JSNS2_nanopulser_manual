The calibration system has the following requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The system is controllable via simple to use, and flexible software. 
\item The part of the system that is inside the LAB filled volume is compatible with LAB.
\item The system does not cause interference on the PMT array.
\item Each pulser produces a very small width in time optical pulse (less than 1~ns risetime at low intensities and less than 2 ns falltime).
\item The system provides full optical coverage of the PMT array for both 420~nm and 355~nm. 
\item The system provides a trigger pulse that can be delayed, with negative amplitude and less than 1 1~V, to be read-out with one channel of the VX1721 flash ADC read-out system.
\end{enumerate}
