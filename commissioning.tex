    \caption{Results of the commissioning at the University of Sussex. The measurements are only relative: settings indicated are for which the trigger pulser and the light pulse were observed at the same time, using the specific test set-up at Sussex; the amplitude was as measured with a Hamatsu mini-PMT with mylar filter using the maximum light output setting.}
